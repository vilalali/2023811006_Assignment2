## About the Assignment

This assignment involves implementing and evaluating three neural network language models:

*   **FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network):** A simple model using n-grams as input.
*   **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** A sequential model capturing temporal dependencies.
*   **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** An advanced RNN that helps to mitigate vanishing gradient problems, that will help learn long term dependencies.

The models are trained on the "Pride and Prejudice" and "Ulysses" corpora. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Optuna, and models are evaluated based on perplexity and train/validation losses. Finally, after the training completes, loss graph is generated and test perplexity score is calculated.

## Approach

The implementation follows these steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The text data is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
2.  **Vocabulary Creation:** A vocabulary is created from the training data.
3.  **Model Definition:** Implementations of the FFNN, RNN, and LSTM models are created and added to `train.py`.
4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optuna is used to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
5.  **Training:** Train the final models using the hyperparameters, and save the model.
6.  **Evaluation:** Calculate the test perplexity and plot the training and validation losses after the training.

## Execution

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.**
2.  **Create virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv envAssignment2
source env/bin/activate
```
3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.  **Download the data:** Download the data from the link that has been provided by the assignment and place them inside the `data` folder.
5.  **Run the training script:** To train a model, use the following command, replacing `<model_type>` with `ffnn`, `rnn`, or `lstm` and `<path_to_corpus>` with the path to the corpus:

```bash
python src/train.py --lm_type <model_type> --corpus_path <path_to_corpus> --epochs <number_of_epochs> --model_dir <path_to_save_models>
```

For example, to train the FFNN model for 10 epochs:

```bash
python src/train.py --lm_type ffnn --corpus_path data/Pride-and-Prejudice-Jane-Austen.txt --epochs 10 --n_gram 5
```

For example, to train the RNN model for 10 epochs:

```bash
python src/train.py --lm_type rnn --corpus_path data/Pride-and-Prejudice-Jane-Austen.txt --epochs 10
```

The saved models and the training plots, can be found inside the `./model` directory.

6.  **Run the Generator** use the following command,
```bash
python src/generator.py ffnn data/Pride-and-Prejudice-Jane-Austen.txt 5 --model_path models/best_tune_ffnn_final_model.pth
```

Follow the instructions in the prompt. Enter a sentence and see top 3 possible predictions by the provided model.

**Generated Graph Example:**

(Include a sample image of the generated loss graph here if possible)

## Implementation Assumptions
*   **Padding**: The padding is done dynamically inside the data loaders of the train and test scripts.
*   **Best Model load** The models load their respective best saved state dictionary after the hyper paramter tuning.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of neural language models, including FFNN, RNN, and LSTM, for next word prediction. This README provides the necessary steps for setting up and running the code.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Save this content into a file named `README.md` in the main project directory (`assignment2/`).
2.  Add the dependency libraries and their versions used in the execution in the `requirements.txt`.

With these steps, you should have a good `README.md` that properly provides all the relevant information for your project. If there are any further concerns, do not hesitate to ask.
